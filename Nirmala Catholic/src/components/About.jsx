                    <p>Kamla Rai College, a constituent unit of Jai Prakash University, Chapra.
                        It is the first degree college of the Gopalganj District established in
                        1956. The college was founded by Shri Kamla Rai, a great freedom fighter,
                        MLA and president of the Saran District Board with a mission to promote
                        higher education in this region. This remote rural district of Bihar
                        adjacent to Kushi Nagar (Uttar Pradesh) and Champaran has always been
                        deprived of the basic facilities in the field of education. This college
                        has fulfilled the need and dream of the people of this locality. A galaxy
                        of great scholars in their subjects is the prime source of inspiration
                        to the students and an asset to the college. Their effective teachings
                        with new, innovative methods and teachings have brought name and fame
                        to the college. Their contribution to the research works in their
                        respective fields is also commendable.
